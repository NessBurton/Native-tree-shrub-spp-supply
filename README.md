# Project-SOWT2

A space for analysis for the Creation topic within the State of Woods and Trees v2.

## Working topic title: Tree supply for thriving new woodland ecosystems

### Research questions

1. Are we meeting targets, and is current creation even replacing loss from P&D and extreme weather events?

2. What is the gap between 'ideal' tree species demand (based on regionally distinctive woodland communities and national creation targets) and current supply?
